	_pic = (getText (configFile >> 'cfgVehicles' >> _weapon >> 'picture'));
	_txt = (getText (configFile >> 'cfgVehicles' >> _weapon >> 'displayName'));
};
_killMessage = format ["%1 was killed by %2", (name _victim), (name _killer)];

Gr8s_kill_msg = [(name _killer), _pic, (name _victim), floor(_victim distance _killer), _txt, nil, nil];
if (LogPlayerKills) then {format["logGr8Kill:%1:%2:%3:%4:%5:%6:%7", (name _killer), getPlayerUID _killer, (name _victim), getPlayerUID _victim, _txt, floor(_victim distance _killer), _overallRespectChange] call ExileServer_system_database_query_insertSingle;};

_weapon = currentWeapon _killer;
_txt = (gettext (configFile >> 'cfgWeapons' >> _weapon >> 'displayName'));
_pic = (gettext (configFile >> 'cfgWeapons' >> _weapon >> 'picture'));
if (_pic == "") then {
   _weapon = typeOf (vehicle _killer);
   _pic = (getText (configFile >> 'cfgVehicles' >> _weapon >> 'picture'));
   _txt = (getText (configFile >> 'cfgVehicles' >> _weapon >> 'displayName'));
};
["systemChatRequest", [format["%1 was killed by an NPC! (%2m Distance)", (name _victim), floor(_victim distance _killer)]]] call ExileServer_object_player_event_killfeed;
// KILL MESSAGES BY GR8
Gr8s_kill_msg = ["NPC", _pic, (name _victim), floor(_victim distance _killer), _txt, nil, nil];
if (LogAIKills) then {format["logGr8Kill:%1:%2:%3:%4:%5:%6:%7", "NPC", getPlayerUID _killer, (name _victim), getPlayerUID _victim, _txt, floor(_victim distance _killer), 0] call ExileServer_system_database_query_insertSingle;};

* Exucute `killfeed.sql` that came with the download into your database. (via PHPmyAdmin or HeidiSQL, etc)

Kill Feed
--------------------------
* With the latest update. Kills can now be logged in your database. Once you install/update this script. You will see Kill Logs In the `kills` table in your database. It will look something like this :

* This makes it easier to survailance your server or use this data to make a killboard on your website. Something like this :
[`Example`](http://ghostzgamerz.com/pages/exilekills/)
Note : This webpage is not included with this script.

BattlEye Filters
--------------------------
* Open up your `publicvariable.txt`
* Add this in the end of line #2:
```
 !="ShowAIKills" !="ShowPlayerKills" !="LogAIKills" !="LogPlayerKills"
```
* There are more filters needed but thats what i had to do for my servers.
